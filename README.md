### Hi there. I'm Fred. ðŸ‘‹

I work as a professor at the Faculty of Engineering at the Federal University of Mato Grosso ([UFMT](https://www.faeng.ufmt.br/)), in Brazil, where I teach Computer Science content for engineering courses.

I am a Phd student in  artificial intelligence, at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s ([UFG](https://inf.ufg.br/)), where I carry out research on speech processing.

Some of my repositories are available here, a little disorganized, but I still plan to get some order in the future. Some information can be found at:

- [https://www.fredso.com.br/](https://www.fredso.com.br/): my personal web page.
- [https://www.mrfalante.com.br](https://www.mrfalante.com.br): some projects on speech processing in Brazilian Portuguese.
