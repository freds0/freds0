### Hi there. I'm Fred. ðŸ‘‹

I am a professor at the Faculty of Engineering, Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT), Brazil. My main focus is teaching computer science content for engineering courses. Additionally, I am a Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s (UFG). My research interests are in speech processing.

I have some repositories that can be found here, although they may appear disorganized at the moment. I plan to arrange them properly in the future. For more information, please visit:

- [https://www.fredso.com.br/](https://www.fredso.com.br/): my personal web page.
- [https://www.mrfalante.com.br](https://www.mrfalante.com.br): some projects on speech processing in Brazilian Portuguese.
