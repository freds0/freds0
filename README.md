### Greetings! My name is Fred. ðŸ‘‹

I hold the position of a professor at the esteemed Faculty of Engineering within the Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT), located in CuiabÃ¡-MT, Brazil. My academic journey has led me to the achievement of a Ph.D. in the field of Artificial Intelligence from the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s (UFG). My primary area of interest revolves around the realm of NLP.

I've taken the initiative to curate several repositories, which can be accessed here. While they may currently appear somewhat unorganized, I am actively planning to arrange them in a more structured manner in the future. For those seeking additional insights, I kindly invite you to explore further through the following links:

- [https://fredso.com.br](https://www.fredso.com.br): A glimpse into my personal webpage.
- [https://mrfalante.com.br](https://www.mrfalante.com.br): A collection of projects centered around the fascinating domain of speech processing, particularly in the context of Brazilian Portuguese.
