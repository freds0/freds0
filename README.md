### Hi there. I'm Fred. ðŸ‘‹

I work as a professor at the Faculty of Engineering at the Federal University of Mato Grosso ([UFMT](https://www.faeng.ufmt.br/)), in Brazil, where I teach Computer Science content for engineering courses.

I am a Phd student in  artificial intelligence, at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s ([UFG](https://inf.ufg.br/)), where I carry out research on speech processing.

Some of my repositories are available here, a little disorganized, but I still plan to get some order in the future. Some information can be found at:

- My personal web page: [https://www.fredso.com.br/](https://www.fredso.com.br/)
- Project page Mr. Falante, which has a brief description of the projects related to speech: [https://www.mrfalante.com.br](https://www.mrfalante.com.br)

I work as a Machine Learning Engineer in a financial company and I'm a master's degree student in artificial intelligence. I love new challenges involving programming, AI, data, and business. I enjoy working with python (TensorFlow, Keras, Sklearn, pandas, numpy) and typescript in Angular projects. My interest is to create new open source projects to help the community with AI and data science.
